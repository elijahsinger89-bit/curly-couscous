# Decisions

Dated, with the reason. A reversed decision keeps both entries and says why.
BOSS owns this file.

## 2026-08-30

**D-001 Scope is tap water in, through to V3 the day tank outlet valve.**
Everything downstream of V3 exists and operates. Reason: stated by the owner as
a fixed boundary. V3 is manual and nothing in this project actuates it.

**D-002 Nine agents: WATER, DOSING, MAIN-PANEL, PUMP-BOXES, DISPLAY-BOX,
CONTROL-SOFTWARE, INTERCONNECT, INTEGRATOR, AUDIT.**
Reason: smallest set that covers the work on physical boundaries.

**D-003 STORAGE-AND-FILL and DAY-TANK-AND-LOOPS merged into WATER.**
Reason: owner correction. The proposed split created four crossings between two
agents doing the same discipline in the same room. Day tank floats sat in one
agent's tank and belonged to the other's fill chain. The transfer pump
discharged into the other agent's tank. Manifold suction and return were two
more. The owner does the plumbing himself and is proficient at it. The seams
cost something and bought nothing. Recorded in traps.md as T-001.

**D-004 CONTROL-SOFTWARE stays separate from DISPLAY-BOX even though they share
an enclosure.** Reason: the seam between them is a pin and address map. Frozen
in writing it is checkable by a second agent. Left inside one agent it is not.
This is a deliberate exception to dividing on physical boundaries and the only
one. Interface S-12.

**D-005 The permissive chain is owned physically by MAIN-PANEL.**
It crosses four subsystems and reaches the field: MAIN-PANEL builds the
electrical chain, DISPLAY-BOX drives the coil and reads the auxiliary contact,
PUMP-BOXES is the load it removes, WATER places the leak sensors and the float
devices. Its terminations S-07 and S-08 are BOSS-owned interfaces. Reason: a
chain that nobody owns at the ends is how this build fails.

**D-006 DOSING owns the whole wet path: manifold, injection ports, dose tubing,
suction tubing, the nutrient jugs, and how a jug is placed and changed.**
PUMP-BOXES ends at the head barb. Reason: owner correction. In the first
proposal the jugs and suction tubing were between two agents and owned by
neither. Recorded in traps.md as T-002.

## Owner decisions taken as given, not revisitable by any agent

These were stated by the owner as already decided. An agent that wants one
changed reports to BOSS and does not act.

| ID | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| G-01 | Float switches are hardwired to relays and invisible to the Pi | Level control is hardware, not software |
| G-02 | The Pi gets exactly one level signal: a dry contact saying a day tank fill is in progress | Deliberate. It is the only level information software has |
| G-03 | Storage and day tank fill use a start float and a stop float with relay seal-in between them | Fills to a level rather than chattering at one point |
| G-04 | No flow meters on the dosing lines. Nothing measures what a peristaltic pump actually delivered | Deliberate. The Pi commands a step count and books the volume as dispensed |
| G-05 | No level sensors on the nutrient jugs. Remaining volume is arithmetic against a user-entered full-jug volume, per channel | Deliberate. Do not add jug floats |
| G-06 | Only one dosing pump turns at a time, mandatory in software | Holds until a thermal measurement says otherwise |
| G-07 | The permissive chain is a hardwired series string. A leak, an E-stop or a lost interlock drops everything independent of the Pi | Safety is not in software |
| G-08 | The leak detection console is wired into the permissive chain and drops power in hardware | As G-07 |
| G-09 | The permissive contactor removes power from every stepper driver at once, and the Pi reads back an auxiliary contact | So a welded contact is detected rather than assumed |
| G-10 | Probes sit first in line in a vertical manifold section, ahead of every injection point | So a bubble cannot corrupt a reading and no injectate reaches a probe before mixing |
| G-11 | The circulation submersible takes suction at the day tank bottom | So the tank mixes |
| G-12 | The chiller and its loop pump are switched together by one contactor on their own circuit | The chiller has no internal pump |
| G-13 | E-stop and manual reset are in the permissive chain and are not software | As G-07 |
| G-14 | UL listing is not gating. Hobby build, no electrical inspection | Owner's stated condition. It does not license unsafe work |
| G-15 | The owner does all part lookups. Agents return a requirement and a search term and stop | No agent states a part number or a spec from memory |

## Parts the owner already has

Listed so no agent re-specifies them. Quantities beyond what is stated here are
not decided and no agent may assume one.
